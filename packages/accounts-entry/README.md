# accounts-entry

A meteorite package that relies on Iron Router and gives you sign page login styles.

We wanted something to work with that used [Iron
Router](https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router), [Bootstrap
3](https://github.com/mangasocial/meteor-bootstrap-3), and didn't require the forcing of the dropdown box that didn't seem to be easily styled. But we love the ease of adding more packages like accounts-f
acebook or accounts-twitter, so we fully support the oauth packages by adding buttons to let people sign-up/sign-in with those services if you add them.  Right now it also assumes you will be using accoun
ts-password, but we will likely make that optional in the future.
